# Input Modes

## Text Mode:
Allows for manual data entry, with a text Indic mode that supports input in multiple languages, including Marathi, Tamil, and Hindi.

## Text Indic Mode
The text Indic mode supports input in multiple languages, including Marathi, Tamil, and Hindi. This mode allows healthcare providers to input patient data in their preferred language, making the system more accessible and user-friendly.

## Voice Mode
The voice mode enables users to input data where the system read aloud the input fields through voice commands in English languages. This mode is ideal for healthcare providers who prefer to use voice commands or who have limited access to manual data entry or image recognition technology.

## Voice Indic Mode
The voice Indic feature reads aloud the input fields in Indic languages, providing better accessibility for healthcare providers who are visually impaired or have difficulty reading text.

## Image Mode: 
Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract data from images, making it easier to digitize physical records.

## Flexible Combination: 
Supports a combination of all five modes, providing flexibility for users to choose the best input method based on their needs.

## View Records Mode:
The view-all-records feature enables healthcare providers to access and view all patient health records in one place. This feature is ideal for healthcare providers who want to access patient data quickly and efficiently.

## Data Visualization Dashboard
The data visualization dashboard allows healthcare providers to view and analyze patient data in real-time. The dashboard provides graphical representations of patient health data, making it easier to identify trends and make informed decisions.
